# Rex - Your Personal AI Assistant

Rex is a web-based chatbot that helps you manage your to-do list. It's built with Python, Flask, and DeepSeek V3.1 API via OpenRouter. Rex is designed to be a simple, yet powerful, example of an AI assistant that can understand and respond to your requests in a conversational way.

## Architecture

The application follows a simple direct API architecture. Here's a breakdown of the components:

- **main.py**: The entry point of the application. It runs a Flask web server that serves the web interface and handles user prompts with direct DeepSeek V3.1 API calls.
- **templates/index.html**: The HTML file for the mobile-first PWA interface.
- **static/style.css**: The CSS file for responsive mobile-first styling.
- **static/script.js**: The JavaScript file for handling user interactions and PWA features.
- **static/manifest.json**: PWA manifest for app store deployment.
- **static/sw.js**: Service worker for offline functionality.
- **storage.json**: This file persists conversation history.

Rex uses direct API calls to DeepSeek V3.1 via OpenRouter, providing fast and reliable AI responses without complex agent frameworks.

## Memory

Snello persists both conversation history and the to-do list in a single JSON file named `storage.json`. This ensures that your conversations and to-do items are saved even after the application is closed.

## Tools
